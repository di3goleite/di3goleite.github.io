Today I'm starting my first post at this blog. Until I get some courage was passed two months.

I want talk about the future and what I will leave to the world after of my passage.

This question appear in my mind because I'm seeing some great people making progress
in amazing projects, and for me I'm not doing anything of value to the world. So, see these
examples:

- [SpaceX successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket after launching it to space](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/21/10640306/spacex-elon-musk-rocket-landing-success)
- [The First Person to Hack the iPhone Built a Self-Driving Car. In His Garage](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car)

These are great examples, because these guys are making big projects that impact
on improving of human life quality of expanding our horizons though space exploration.

Today, I have 22 years old and I'm far to finish my graduate. This happened because
of my choices and today I'm a different person that this guy who started the Computer
Engineering course in first semester of 2012.

I really want contribute with the human evolution, but may I didn't have sufficient
knowledge to do this now. I want to do it first in my city, because of its serious
shortcomings.

Today I'm working in a cool project with some great friends, called: [Take me somewhere
else](http://tamse.me).

Maybe this is my first step to create something thats impact, in
a positive way, the human daily. Making the world evolve more fast and to the right direction.

What you think about it?
